# 📋 TODO Plans

This folder contains **planned features that haven't been implemented yet**.

## What Goes Here

- Feature proposals that have been thought through
- Architecture decisions waiting for implementation
- Ideas that have been validated but not yet built

## Status

All documents in this folder represent **future work**. Once a feature is implemented, the corresponding plan should be:

1. Moved to the main `plans/` folder (or a relevant subfolder)
2. Updated to reflect what was actually built
3. Marked as completed in the ROADMAP.md

## Current TODOs

| Plan | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [Tiered Memory System](./tiered-memory-notion.md) | HOT/WARM/COLD memory with Notion integration | High |
